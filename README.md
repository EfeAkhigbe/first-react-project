# first-react-project

Here is a link to the project https://efeakhigbe.github.io/first-react-project/ 

I learnt a lot about react while building this project.

1. I learnt how to structure a react component.

2. I learnt how to add svg to a react app.

3. I learnt how to implement CSS media query in react.

4. I learnt how to deploy a create-react-app to github pages.
